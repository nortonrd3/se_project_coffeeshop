Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

Plan on improving the project

Hover annimations can be applied to links for a more polished feel. The circles in the header and recipes background can animate so the pages feel less static.
