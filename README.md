# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

The webpage features multiple hover animations but only one animation in the backround of the About section. Additional annimations can be added to other sections for a more dymamic feel.
